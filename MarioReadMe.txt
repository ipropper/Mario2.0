Boxes: They can kill Goombas and reverse mushrooms (Meta Note: mushrooms only reverse if you hit them at the right moment (in both games). 
The feature is a tad buggy in our original level, but it is close to the Mario mechanic.) Being thrown off to the side of the box is NOT a glitch, a similar mechanic exists in Mario.

Fireball: it can kill all enemy unit types. Additionally, as in Mario, the fireball will extinguish if it hits the side of objects. It will, however, bounce on horizontal surfaces. 

Koopas: They can go into shell form and back to turtle form.
